**Password Generator Requirement Document**

**1. Introduction:**
   The password generator is a utility function designed to create secure and randomized passwords based on specified criteria. It ensures a combination of alphabets, symbols, and numbers to enhance password strength and resilience against unauthorized access.

**2. Purpose:**
   The purpose of the password generator is to provide users with a reliable tool for generating strong and unique passwords that meet their security requirements. It aims to enhance data security by encouraging the use of complex passwords that are difficult to guess or brute-force.

**3. Functional Requirements:**
   - **Length Constraint:** The generator must allow the user to specify the desired length of the password.
   - **Minimum Alphabets:** Users should be able to set the minimum number of alphabetic characters required in the password.
   - **Minimum Symbols:** Users should be able to set the minimum number of symbol characters required in the password.
   - **Minimum Numbers:** Users should be able to set the minimum number of numeric characters required in the password.
   - **Randomization:** The generator must ensure randomization of characters to create unique passwords with each execution.
   - **Character Set:** The generator should include a diverse character set comprising alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers.
   - **Password Strength:** The generated passwords should adhere to commonly accepted standards of password strength, ensuring resistance against brute-force attacks.

**4. Non-functional Requirements:**
   - **Security:** The generator must handle user data securely and ensure that generated passwords cannot be easily predicted or reverse-engineered.
   - **Performance:** The generator should execute quickly and efficiently, even for passwords of considerable length.
   - **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to specify their password criteria easily.
   - **Reliability:** The generator should consistently produce passwords that meet the specified criteria and adhere to security best practices.

**5. Constraints:**
   - The password generator is limited to generating passwords based on the character sets available in the Python `string` module (including alphabets, symbols, and numbers).
   - Users must ensure that the specified length of the password is sufficient to accommodate the minimum requirements for alphabets, symbols, and numbers.

**6. Dependencies:**
   - The password generator relies on the Python `random` and `string` modules for generating random characters.
   - The generator may be integrated into larger applications or systems where secure password generation is required.

**7. Usage:**
   - Users can call the `generate_password` function with optional parameters to customize the length and composition of the generated password.
   - Upon execution, the function will return a randomly generated password that meets the specified criteria.

**8. Future Enhancements:**
   - Support for custom character sets or user-defined requirements.
   - Integration with password management systems or tools.
   - Enhanced security features such as password hashing or encryption.

**9. Conclusion:**
   The password generator provides a valuable tool for creating strong and randomized passwords, contributing to improved data security and protection against unauthorized access. By adhering to specified criteria and industry best practices, the generator empowers users to enhance the security of their digital assets and accounts.
